# **Euclid**

_A holistic, AI-powered writing system built on Cloudflare._

**Euclid** turns everyday journaling into structured, publishable content.
You write in your own space, the system learns your voice, and the AI branches off ideas into drafts for multiple platforms — all visualised on an infinite canvas where you can drag, connect, and evolve your thinking.

### **Core Features**

- Daily journaling with automatic semantic indexing
- Personal voice model that adapts as you edit
- Multi-platform content generation (LinkedIn, X, Instagram, Medium, scripts)
- Infinite canvas for navigating ideas, drafts, and branches
- Cloudflare-native stack: Workers, D1, KV, R2, AI Bindings, AutoRAG

### **How It Works**

1. Write a journal entry.
2. Euclid indexes it, updates your voice model, and places it on the canvas.
3. Generate content branches for any platform.
4. Edit the drafts — Euclid learns from your changes.
5. Link, fork, and grow your ideas across the canvas.

A tool for writers, founders, and creators who want their thinking to flow naturally into finished content.
